          MISSILE MAN OF INDIA

        <p class="lead text-white">
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
          Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
          Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
          Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
          local mosque his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned a
          ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and
          the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.

        <p class="lead text-white">
          Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his
          family.His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
          landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land.
          Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and
          Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The
          family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland
          and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims
          between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
          to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
          fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the
          ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was
          born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's
          meager income

          In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a
          bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He
          spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics.After completing
          his education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram,
          Kalam went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from
          where he graduated in Physics in 1954.

          After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960,
          Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
          Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
          Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
          Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career
          by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his
          choice of a job at DRDO.Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under
          Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] He was interviewed
          and recruited into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of
          Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).In 1969, Kalam was
          transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he
          was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle
          (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in
          near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an
          expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam
          received the government's approval and expanded the programme to
          include more engineers.Kalam addresses engineering students at IIT
          Guwahati In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in
          Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland;
          and Wallops Flight Facility.Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an
          effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and
          SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful.
